ooh323c is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2,
a copy of which is included in the installation in the LICENSE.txt
or LICENSE file.  In addition, a "Free/Libre Open Source Software"
(FLOSS) exception is provided as explained below.

***
Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) Exception for ooh323c

1. Intent

We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software ("FLOSS") to be
able to use the specified GPL-licensed ooh323c software (called the
"Program") despite the fact that not all FLOSS licenses are compatible
with version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the "GPL").

It is our intent to allow distribution of the entire Derivative Work
(including the Program) under one or more of the FLOSS licenses listed
in section 3.a. It is also our intent to disallow simple relicensing of
the Program for the sole purpose of using it in proprietary applications
(section 2.b and 2.c). As an example, consider two hypothetical scenarios:

 a) You create a program that uses the ooh323c stack software along with
    other open source software that uses a different open source license.
    You then add additional code to make this a derivative work and make
    all of the source code available to the public.  Due to incompatibilites
    in the licenses, the derivative work is licensed under one of the
    licenses allowable by the FLOSS (sections 2.b and 2.c are satisfied).
    You distribute your program, including the ooh323c source code under
    this license and make it available at no charge to all third
    parties (section 2.a is satisfied). Later you (or someone else) may
    choose to base their proprietary application on your code since the
    BSD license does not prohibit it.

    This scenario falls under this FLOSS Exception.


 b) You created a library that uses the ooh323c stack software. You
    did not add to the library any other useful code that uses the
    ooh323c software (neither section 2.b nor 2.c is satisfied). You
    distribute your library, including the ooh323c source code under
    a different open source license allowed by the FLOSS and
    make it available at no charge to all third parties (section 2.a
    is satisfied). Later you base your proprietary application on this
    library since the BSD license does not prohibit it.

    This scenario does not fall under this FLOSS Exception (neither
    section 2.b nor 2.c is satisfied). You created the library for the
    sole purpose of making the ooh323c library available to your
    proprietary application.


2. Legal Terms and Conditions

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2 of
the GPL you are free to distribute a verbatim copy of the Program
as part of the Derivative Work that is formed from the Program or
any part thereof and one or more works (each, a "FLOSS Work") as
long as you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) You must cause the Derivative Work that in whole or in part
     contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
     to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
     under the terms of one or more of the licenses listed in
     section 3.

  b) The Derivative Work should contain one or more FLOSS Work that
     can be reasonably considered as derived from the Program or some
     part thereof.

  c) The Derivative Work should not contain any part of the Program
     that cannot be reasonably considered as a base of one or more
     FLOSS Work.


3. FLOSS License List

  a) Any license listed in the "GPL-Compatible Free Software Licenses"
     and the "GPL-Incompatible Free Software Licenses" sections of the
     License List as published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF):

4. Definitions

Terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning provided in
the GPL.

Derivative Work means a derivative work under copyright law.


5. Applicability

You may choose to redistribute a copy of the Program exclusively under
the terms of the GPL by removing the FLOSS Exception notice from that
copy of the Program.
