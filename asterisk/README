Objective Systems asterisk-ooh323c driver for supporting H.323 on Asterisk

Thank you for downloading Objective Systems H.323 driver for Asterisk. This
package contains a driver which will enable ooh323c, a C based open source
H.323 stack from Objective Systems(www.obj-sys.com/open), to be used with
Asterisk, an open source IP-PBX solution, from Digium, Inc.(www.asterisk.org).

Capabilities supported: ulaw, gsm, g728, g729, g729a, g723.1, rfc2833

This version of the channel driver is compatible with Asterisk add-ons
version 1.6.2.1.

How to build:
-------------

1. Make sure you have an up-to-date version of Asterisk installed.  This
release was prepared against Asterisk version 1.6.2.9 which is the minimum
supported version.  Go to the www.asterisk.org site to get the latest
version of Asterisk and follow the installation instructions for that
package.

2. Install the latest version of the Asterisk add-ons package.  This
package already contains a version of ooh323c in the 'channels' subdirectory
that has been tested to work with Asterisk.  The driver code from our web-site
is typically somewhat ahead of this version in terms of stability and
features.

3. Copy the asterisk-ooh323c-<version>.tar.gz package into the Asterisk
add-ons root directory and tar and unzip.  For example:

  cp asterisk-ooh323c-<version>.tar.gz ./asterisk-addons-1.6.2.1
  gunzip asterisk-ooh323c-<version>.tar.gz
  tar xvf asterisk-ooh323c-<version>.tar

Make sure you have sufficient priveleges to overwrite existing files in
that directory.

4. This will replace the existing ooh323c code with the updated Objective
Systems code.  From here, you can just follow the add-ons build procedure
as documented in the Asterisk add-ons package.


Configuration:
--------------

1. Open the ooh323.conf.sample in the asterisk-addons-<version>/channels
directory. Under [general] you will see global configuration setting.
Modify the IP addresses of Asterisk server "bindaddr" to match your
configuration.

2. Copy the modified file to ooh323.conf in the Asterisk configuration
files directory in your installation (typically /etc/asterisk).

3. Run Asterisk as

   >/usr/sbin/asterisk -vvvc

4. From the Asterisk console, you can check whether the H.323 channel is
registered properly using the following command:

   CLI>core show channeltypes

To see all the defined H323 users.
   CLI>ooh323 show users
  
To see details of a specific user
   CLI>ooh323 show user myuser1

To see all the defined peers
   CLI>ooh323 show peers
   
To see details of a specific peer
   CLI>ooh323 show peer mypeer1

Log files produced by Asterisk and ooh323c can be found in the
/var/logs/asterisk directory.

Getting Started with some simple examples:
-----------------------------------------
First stop Asterisk as follows:
   CLI>core stop now

To run tests, you will have to copy extensions.conf.sample in
the asterisk-addons-<version>/channels directory to /etc/asterisk as
extensions.conf. Make sure to save a backup copy of your existing
extensions.conf. Now restart Asterisk as follows:

   >/usr/sbin/Asterisk -vvvc

Asterisk with a sample dial plan should now be running.

Test1:
--------
Someone from outside calls into the Asterisk server and a recorded message is
played back to him.

1. You need an h323 phone (phone1) to test. You can use any H.323 phone
   including NetMeeting or an OpenH323 based phone.  MyPhone can be
   downloaded from http://www.h323plus.org/source/.

2. Call the IP address on which asterisk is running using the phone
   application.


Test2:
--------
A registered user calls into the Asterisk server at a particular extension and
a different message is played back to him.

1. Use ohphone as a registered user myuser1 to call extension 100 in
   Asterisk as follows:

   >./ohphone -n -u myuser1 -tttt -o trace.log 100@<ip of Asterisk server>

   The ohphone will send calls to Asterisk, which will identify the user as
   myuser1, and use the user's context to handle extension 100, which
   playbacks a pre-recorded message.

Test3:
--------
A registered user calls an extension which belongs to a peer and the call is
routed to the peer's phone

1. Use one more h323 phones (phone2) as a peer.

2. Stop Asterisk using:

       CLI>stop now

3. Open /etc/Asterisk/ooh323.conf. Modify ip/port of mypeer1 to match those of
   the h323 phone you are going to use as peer.

4. Run your peer phone phone2 as follows:

     >./ohphone -n -u mypeer1 -tttttt -o trace.log -l

   This keeps phone2 in listen mode.

5. Now run Asterisk as follows:
   
    >/usr/sbin/asterisk -vvvc

6. Check details of peer for ip/port
   
    CLI>ooh323 show peer mypeer1

7. Now use phone1 to make a call to Asterisk at extension 101 as follows.

    >./ohphone -n -u myuser1 -ttttt -o trace.log 101@<ip of Asterisk>
