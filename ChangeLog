Release 0.3: New Features
1. New Design
   a. Allows handling multiple simultaneous calls
   b. Unique call identifiers for calls
   c. Applications can add capabilities and register control functions
      such as start/stop for managing those media channels. The stack
      just calls start/stop callback functions to start or stop media
      channel.
   d. Applications are much simpler to write as they just have to initialize
      end point with all the capabilities and stack handles all the message
      exchanges, unlike the earlier design where application had to build
      SETUP, CONNECT etc. messages

2. Debugging capabilities
   a. Prints all received messages to log
   b. Prints call-ids to identify which log message is associated with which
      call.

3. Detects remote endpoints abruptly closing TCP connections.

4.Verifies that the Capability specified in the OpenLogicalChannel by remote
  endpoint is actually supported by local endpoint.
